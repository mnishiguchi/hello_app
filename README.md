# Hello app

## Setting up Rails development environment (OS X)

### 1. Preparing basic tools
- Text editor: Atom etc
- Terminal: iTerm etc
- Browser: Chrome etc
- Git

### 2. Install a Ruby version management tool
- Either [Ruby Version Manager (RVM)](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
- Allow you to install and manage multiple versions of Ruby on the same machine.
- NOTE: RVM and rbenv canâ€™t be used on the same system simultaneously
  + check `$ which rvm` and `$ which rbenv`

#### [Install RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)
```bash
# Install RVM
$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash

# Reload this shell and initialize rvm.
$ exec bash -l

# Update rvm
$ rvm get master

# Install ruby
$ rvm install 2.3.1
# NOTE: If you get the warning below, you can safely ignore it and move on to step 3.
# * WARNING: You have '~/.profile' file, you might want to load it,
#   to do that add the following line to '/Users/adamzerner/.bash_profile':

# Configure your default version of ruby
$ rvm use 2.3.1 --default
```

#### If you ever get stuck with RVM
```bash
$ rvm help
$ rvm gemset help
```

)

### Install RubyGems
- RubyGems is a package manager for Ruby projects.
- Provides the `gem` command.
- NOTE: If you have installed RVM, you already have RubyGems, since RVM includes it automatically.
  + Check `$ which gem`

### Install Rails
```bash
# Install Rails with a specific version number.
$ gem install rails -v 4.2.2
```

## Creating a new app with PostgreSQL

### Before starting
- Ensure that Ruby and Rails are installed.
- Ensure that Git initial configuration is completed.

### Generate a new app (with PostgreSQL)
```bash
$ cd ~/workspace
$ rails _4.2.0_ new myapp -d postgresql
$ cd sample_app/
```

### Install and include the gems needed by the app useing Bundler
- Edit Gemfile.
- Run `$ bundle install --without production` for the first time.
- Run `$ bundle update` to update gems.

### Set config/database.yml's username
- By default, the same as your OS X user account.

### Create the database
`$ rake db:create`

### Check if it works on local server
```bash
$ rails server # Vist http://localhost:3000/
```
